# Part 1 - Before the Project

This project appears to be a recreation of the Google homepage, given the title of the project folder we were told to create. I will do my best to complete the project as well as it can be completed, but will use the experience to learn from my mistakes. I will reflect upon whatever mistakes I made and discuss what I learned from them after completing this project.
